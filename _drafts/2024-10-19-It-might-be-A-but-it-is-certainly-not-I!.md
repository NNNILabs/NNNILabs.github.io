# It might be A but it is certainly not I!

Certainly one of the biggest debacles of the mid-2020s is the hype surrounding what is aggressively being marketed and pushed as AI.

There are two facts that must immediately be made clear. Yes, this is a hit piece *aginst* AI. I do not like the way it is being marketed. Yes, I have used ChatGPT to perform various useful technical tasks, because it can help me with certain problems.

There's a few common talking points used by the part of the general populace who are more affine to, or simply and naively want to present a talking point for, AI.

1. But human artists learn from other artists and 'copy' their work too!

Human beings are physically and mentally incapable of collecting, reading and generalizing the contents of the entire internet, and being able to reproduce it in a grammatically perfect and consistent style. Humans make mistakes, and even if one were to _attempt_ to make an exact copy of someone's art or style, it would be possible, if not easy, to make out differences arising due to imperfections. To err is human! While it is true that art students, when taken as an example, are exposed to the work of famous artists, it is much more than exposure to prior art that created people like Dali, Picasso and Van Gogh. They were _human_ - they had an upbringing that shaped them and their emotions, they interacted with the people around them, which led to a mutual exchange of feelings and ideas, and they lived in the unique locations which inspired them. AI does not have a 'life' and an 'upbringing' - it is an algorithm that exists purely inside a machine. It can be programmed to emulate any of the above, but it is exactly that - programmed.

2. If you don't want your art to be used to train AI, don't post it on the internet!

I've actually had this said to me.

What is the internet for? A non-consensual farming ground for the creation of content by computer algorithms? A place for the interchange of information and experiences, in the form of text, pictures, audio or video? A place to exchange ideas and further science? Do you have to specifically have the intention of wanting your material scraped by an AI corporation to be able to post anything on the internet?

3. But AI is so good! It will replace a lot of jobs!

AI is only good because the content it scraped (which were created by people just like you and me, and some very smart ones) is good.

I had the particular displeasure of coming across YouTube user '@firexgodx980' who was feverishly defending AI under a 3Blue1Brown short video[^].

> That's a gross oversimplification. LLMs are also Turing complete, just like humans. For all we know, humans are "just" next word predictors too.

There is a common theme, of either reducing the value of a human being by equating him to a computer algorithm, that is spreading on the internet, or the opposite, giving the computer algorithm more credit than it actually deserves. This is demonstrated by another reply from the same user.

> It's a gross simplification. Imagine calling human consciousness "just electrical signals". For all we know humans are "just" next word predictors as well. LLMs do predict next words, but they are also thinking and reasoning and planning while doing so.

A human being might draw upon years of experience, without being limited by the recentness or breadth of his 'training data', and draw inspiration from completely unrelated fields and sources. An AI, on the other hand, has at it's disposal what is basically a large probability table. It can only suggest the technically 'correct' (as in, most probable) next word, and that word itself is dependent on the training data. If the training data suggests that the word 'deception' had the highest occurence in similar sentences, the AI will gladly add 'deception' to the sentence it was formulating, with no self-awareness. Once again - if the AI is 'correct', it is only because some source(s) in the training data were correct too. Humans do not have the memory to remember exact facts to verify the correctness of a statement, but can infer based on context and experience.

(non-consensual, false marketing)
