# The Math Rant

## Introduction

The creation of this website was not a harmonious and independent decision - after the publication of what I consider my [magnum opus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrzEJI-8Miw){:target="_blank"}[^1] (so far), it's theory-heavy content and my signature fast delivery made it quite hard to digest on the first watch... or even a second, or a third. What was desired was a *write-up* that one could read and digest at one's own pace. And a write-up calls for a website.

It left me with a weird feeling to know that the effort of having worked on the video for more than a year, and having edited it for six days straight went basically unappreciated (and it would be unfair to expect it to be, something like a sunken-cost fallacy), and I was being *asked* to make a website instead of me considering the idea, when the time was right, of my own free will.

However, after spending a few days thinking about what I would do with the website. it dawned upon me that this rant, which has been simmering inside me for more than a decade, would be the perfect excuse. I could get my feelings out, and at the same time, deliver upon the expectation of a write-up (in the form of first uploading the video script - a stopgap solution).

The occurence of having something forced upon me, instead of me coming across it and *wanting* it as a natural progression of my needs and education, is the perfect starting point of my extremely unhealthy relationship with the field of [Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics){:target="_blank"}.

*Gleich vor Weg*: The highly emotional nature of this rant places it firmly in the 'Trash' category. Since the Internet is increasingly becoming the world's dumping ground for trash of all kind (what happened to the dreams of a universal scientific exchange and a repository of knowledge, and that begs the question, are we really better off as a species now, or more divided and exploited?), it is only fitting.

## The Problem



## The Solution (or Lack Thereof)

There have been countless tirades about the state of the modern education system and it's flaws, but none seem to offer a solution to the problem. Consider this - what if there was none?

The concept of schools have existed since the times of the Egyptians[] and probably longer. At least to me, it does not make sense to go against thousands of years of historical precedence and abolish formal education. There must certainly have been detractors even back then, but the system of putting a group of children in a room together with an adult, and having the adult teach a certain well-defined subject, has prevailed. A couple thousand years is quite a long time, if you think about it.

what I have come to learn is that, for most things, a good 90% of the people don't know or care about the details. Only the superficial effects or benefits are taken into account, if at all.

My first few weeks at the [Hochschule Hannover](https://www.hs-hannover.de/){:target="_blank"} were particularly eye-opening. Unlike my previous semester at the [Leibniz Universit√§t Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/de/){:target="_blank"}, where most fellow students had a Gymnasium background, the students at HsH had more diverse backgrounds, and not all of them had the same level of mathematics education that I did. I came to that sudden realization when a classmate of mine asked me during the pre-semester prep course, about adding unlike fractions, and why we needed to find a common denominator. This caused me to raise my eyebrows slightly. I would (at least, from the Indian perspective), consider this elementary or middle school knowledge. Of course, I did explain to him (and I have come up with a wonderful explanation as to why, which I looking forward to sharing with my children) why that was the case, but this put me in a thoughtful mood for the rest of the day.

I have been complaining endlessly about my dislike for going to school since I was around nine. I had a particularly rebellious phase between the ages of fourteen and fifteen (classes 9 and 10), and some escapades led to me basically deliberately failing math exams to 'prove a point', the 'point' always falling on deaf ears.

I was extremely glad to finish my schooling, and I was so disgusted by the way everything over the last decade had gone, that I forgot everything I ever learned. For the knowledge had served it's purpose - I somehow passed the AISSCE 2020 with very reasonable grades, which I attribute completely to a combination of luck and the COVID-19 pandemic.

But having completed my schooling in India, I was now suddenly equipped with a lot of mathematical skills, which I had taken for granted and didn't even realize I posessed until that fateful day in the prep course. Everything I have learned so far in the first semester - simplifying equations, finding the roots of polynomials, polynomial division - were the basics of what I had learned in school. I ended up being the only one to score well on a quick class test (8/10 points), while the others barely got 3 or 4. In hindsight, I was able to appreciate, even if just a little, the knowledge that was forced upon me.

I still doubt if I would ever be faced with a situation in the future where I would need to manually solve complex integrals or differential equations as we did in classes 11 and 12. My disastrous first semester at LUH proved otherwise, but the ultimate goal was the acquisition of a Bachelor's degree, still no concrete promise of ever needing to use the mentioned mathematics in a professional setting. Being able to help my children with their math homework serves as one possible source of motivation, but it is very difficult to apply reverse-hindsight in the past, when the future still has not happened.

Statistics forms a large exception. The basics of probability and binomial theory were indeed taught, if not very well, in class 11. Unfortunately, that knowledge served the purpose of helping me pass class 11. I am now left asking myself, why did I have so much advanced theoretical mathematics pushed on me when I was not ready for it, but now, after having done analog electronics for a few years and being interested in delta-sigma ADCs, I regret not knowing more statistics, which would greatly help me decode papers and undestand, within a mathematical framework, what was going on. I have also had situations where what I *wanted* to learn was indeed taught to me, but always, a severe case of 'not invented here'[^] set in, and I tend to not take it seriously, and regret it in the future.

The above is an excellent example of why the modern education system is built upon regret and hindsight. What I would need, and would *feel the need for*, was *actually* taught to me in a formal setting (with a very good textbook from the NCERT), but I was too naive to realize it. The creators of the curriculum, being much older and more experienced than I am, had the power of hindsight, and *knew* I would need it.

It could be argued that it is the job of the teacher to connect the purely theoretical an ideal world of the textbook to reality. On one hand, teachers in India - more specifically, the ones I liked to call 'career' teachers; those whose aim was to become one, were trained to be one, and did indeed end up in classrooms, while  lacking any real connection to the subject they were teaching, outside having been taught the subject from a textbook - seem to lack any awareness of what was going on in the wide world outside the classroom. Wouldn't it be unfair to ask them to somehow justify the teaching and learning of concepts that might *possibly* help in the future? On the other hand, even if a teacher were to tell me, that future me would be wildly interested in MASH modulators and delta-sigma modulators, and teach probability and statisics from that perspective, most of the background would have still gone right over the 16-year-old me. This is quite paradoxical - while the mathematics itself might have been 'pushed' upon us, the justification would be simiarly forced, while we didn't have an understanding or appreciation of what was to come in our future lives.

If I had been given the choice back then to avoid mathematics, I would have gladly done so - but that would have not given me the percieved edge I have over my classmates at HsH, and might have further incapacitated me in unforseen ways.

All I can say at this point is that I'm very thankful for the way things have turned out - even if I was not, and might not, always be.

Ultimately, the education system has 'worked' in the sense that it has churned out a large mass of people, who are expected to be mathematically aware up to a certain level - regardless of if they still apply or remember what was taught. In that sense, the system, which I have taken great pleasure over the years in criticizing, has ultimately been a success.

For all those who were outcast, outpaced, and outspoken like I was - books and the internet exist. I cannot attribute anything I have learned in my hobby to formal education. Everything, right up to delta-sigma modulation and my current interest in optimal decoding algorithms, has been completely self-taught, fuelled by an intransparent motivation, inscrutable even to myself.
